        <h2>5 short term goals I have and hope to accomplish in the next two years: 
    
    

        <ol>
            <li>I would like to complete my current program at NSCC in good academic standing with a good GPA.</li>
            <li>I would like to keep modifying my website as I learn new things throughout my education to make it more professional.</li>
            <li>I would like to work on some LinkedIn Learning courses that interest me.</li>
            <li>I would like to attend a networking event so I can meet people in the industry.</li>
            <li>I would like to work on </li>
        </ol>

        <div>
          <h2>Here is how I plan to achieve these goals:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Goal 1</dt>
        <dd> I plan to achieve this by getting into a good studying routine, reviewing regularly, reaching out to my instructors for help <br> and advice. I also
            plan to make good use of the resources available to me as a student, such as peer tutoring, the accessability center and a private tutor.</dd>

        <dt>Goal 2</dt>
        <dd> I plan to achieve this by keeping a separate folder on my computer for easy access, and I have created my own repository on <br>
            GitHub so I can keep track of my project. As I learn more programming languages, I will be able to add new features and designs<br>
            to my website, that way when I graduate and look for a job, I will be able to tailor my website to fit the job while<br> showcasing my abilities.</dd>

        <dt>Goal 3</dt>
        <dd>All NSCC students have access to LinkedIn Learning for free, so I am able to access any courses or certifications on the website. This will be useful
            for professional development and gaining skills while working on current skills. 
        </dd>

        <dt>Goal 4</dt>
        <dd>I would like to attend at least one event to network with others in the industry and put myself out there. I have never gone to an event
            like that before but I know it will be very useful for when I graduate.
        </dd>

        <dt>Goal 5</dt>
        <dd></dd>
